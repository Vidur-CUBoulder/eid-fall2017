# Project 1: Basic Qt Interface

This is a basic Qt interface that utilizes the DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor on the Raspberry Pi3. It populates the temperature and humidity values every second and has a visual alarm that can be set. The label will turn Red when the alarm value is exceeded.
